# Shrimp Scampi

From [Cooking Classy](https://www.cookingclassy.com/shrimp-scampi/)

## Ingredients
 - Linguine – feel free to use any type of pasta, linguine is just what I prefer for the recipe. Spaghetti, angel hair or fettuccine are other great options.
 - Extra large shrimp – just like the pasta, you can swap out a different size shrimp if you want something smaller that doesn’t need to be cut up.
 - Olive oil – preferably stick with good quality extra virgin olive oil here, no substitutes.
 - Unsalted butter – this is vital for making the amazing garlic butter sauce we all love.
 - Garlic – stick with fresh garlic for best results. It’s a key flavor here and to build up the best final flavor use the best ingredients.
 - Dry white wine – I prefer this with white wine for that traditional flavor but low-sodium chicken is another tasty option.
 - Salt and freshly ground black pepper – a must bringing out the flavors of the dish.
 - Red pepper flakes – these are optional if you like a kick, but use sparingly. A little goes a long way with red pepper flakes.
 - Fresh lemon juice – only use fresh lemon juice, not bottled. It makes a world of difference.
 - Chopped fresh parsley – this garnish provides a dash of color and mild flavor to round out the dish.
