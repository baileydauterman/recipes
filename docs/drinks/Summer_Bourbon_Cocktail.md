Prep Time 10 minutes
Total Time 10 minutes
Servings 2 cocktails

## Ingredients

- 6 medium fresh strawberries, hulled and quartered
- 2 &frac12;" thick circular slices of orange, rind removed and cut into bit sized pieces
- 8 oz bourbon, rye, or whiskey
- ice for shaker and for serving
- strawberry and orange slice for garnish (optional)

##Instructions

1. In a large cocktail shaker, muddle the strawberry and orange. Add the bourbon to the shaker and fill with ice. With the lid on the shaker, shake until the outside of the shaker is frosty cold.
2. Fill 2 low ball glasses with ice (optional) and pour the mixture evenly into the glasses. 
3. Garnish with a strawberry and an orange slice (optional).

Recipe Notes
The mixture is quite pulpy inside the shaker, which can make it hard to pour. Pour as much as you can, and clear the pulp if the shaker starts to clog by shaking again.

There will be quite a lot of booze left in the shaker with the pulp. You can get this by placing the pulp in a fine mesh sieve and pressing the pulp with the back of a spoon with a bowl under the sieve to catch the liquid.
