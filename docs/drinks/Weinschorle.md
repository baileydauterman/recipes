# Weinschorle (German Wine Spritzer)

This German wine spritzer - also known as a Weinschorle - is a great dinner time or social drink. Made from your choice of white wine and carbonated water, Weinschorle is a drink that is not too strong and very refreshing!
This is the reason I was able to do 12 hour wine tours on the Mosel. If you can find Trocken Riesling (Dry, White, German) it goes well. 

## Ingredients
- white wine, dry (or semi-dry depending on personal preference)
- carbonated water

## Instructions

Add white wine to a wine glass. Then add the same amount of carbonated water.

Notes
If you want it to be stronger, can also mix it 2:1 wine to water.
If you want it weaker, mix it 1:2 wine to water.
