Learn how to make a classic Aperol spritz! These bubbly Italian cocktails are refreshing and so easy to make. Aperol spritzes are best made one by one, so the recipe is written to yield one cocktail and you can make more as necessary. Cheers!

## Ingredients

- Ice
- 3 oz (1 part) Aperol
- 3 oz (1 part) dry Prosecco
- 1 oz (a splash) club soda or unflavored sparkling water
- Orange slice, for garnish

## Instructions

1. Add ice to a wine glass until it is nearly full.
2. Pour in the Aperol
    - I usually eyeball this and pour until Iâ€™ve filled about one-third of the glass.
3. Pour in an equal amount of Prosecco.
4. Top your drink off with a splash of club soda and add a slice of orange. Enjoy!
