# Classic Aperol Spritz

Prep Time: 3 minutes 
Total Time: 3 minutes 
Yield: 1 cocktail 

Learn how to make a classic Aperol spritz! These bubbly Italian cocktails are refreshing and so easy to make. Aperol spritzes are best made one by one, so the recipe is written to yield one cocktail and you can make more as necessary. Cheers!

## Ingredients

Per cocktail
- Ice
- 3 oz (1 part) Aperol
- 3 oz (1 part) dry Prosecco
- 1 ounce (a splash) club soda or unflavored sparkling water
- Orange slice, for garnish

## Instructions

1. Add ice to a wine glass until it is nearly full. Pour in the Aperol (I usually eyeball this and pour until Iâ€™ve filled about one-third of the glass).
2. Pour in an equal amount of Prosecco. Top your drink off with a splash of club soda and add a slice of orange. Enjoy!

NOTES
Make it less bitter: Use less Aperol and more Prosecco.
Make it less boozy: Use more club soda, and less Aperol and Prosecco.

Recommended equipment: I really love the stemless wine glasses
