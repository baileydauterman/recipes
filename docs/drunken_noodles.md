## Ingredients
- 1/4 cup soy sauce
- 3 tablespoons lime juice
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons sriracha
- 8 ounces rice noodles, I love the brown rice noodles from Lotus Foods
- 3 teaspoons toasted sesame oil, divided
- 1 package extra firm tofu [^1], drained, pressed and finely diced or crumbled.
- White or yellow onion, sliced
- 2 cups shredded green cabbage

- Red bell pepper, sliced
- Yellow bell pepper, sliced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced

## Instructions

1. Whisk together soy sauce, lime juice, brown sugar and sriracha in a bowl.
2. Prepare the noodles according to package directions (usually soaking in hot water until al dente).
3. Heat 1 teaspoon sesame oil in a large wok or pan and add the tofu [^1]. Lightly fry until just cooked through, stirring often, about 5 minutes.
4. Remove the tofu [^1] and add the remaining 2 teaspoons sesame oil. Add the onion, cabbage, peppers, garlic and scallions to the pan; stir-fry 8-10 minutes, until soft.
5. Stir in the prepared noodles, tofu [^1] and soy sauce mixture. Toss well and stir fry for another 2 minutes until the vegetables are tender and the noodles are hot.
6. Stir in the basil leaves. Serve with lime wedges for squeezing.
