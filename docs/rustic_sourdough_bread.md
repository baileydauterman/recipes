homegrown sourdough starter following that all
salt
instant rise yeast
all-purpose flour
00:21
typically and unbleached 
step one in activating your yeast is to collect three quarters of a cup of warm water I
00:27
don't have a thermometer so I'm just
00:29
feeling it out right now
00:30
place that water in a larger bowl and
00:33
add between 1 and 2 teaspoons of your
00:35
fast rise nice depending on the
00:36
healthiness of your starter my starter
00:39
is a little under the weather after
00:40
enough currently getting enough tension
00:41
while moving from house to house however
00:44
to this mixture you're gonna add 1/2 a
00:46
cup of your starter and stir until well
00:47
combined
00:51
[Music]
00:54
set that mixture aside for about ten
00:57
minutes to give that yeast a little bit
00:58
of time to wake up and in the meantime
01:00
we're gonna start incorporating our dry
01:02
ingredients in a separate Bowl for this
01:04
recipe from King Arthur Flour you're
01:06
gonna need about two and a half cups of
01:09
all-purpose flour add just a pinch of
01:12
salt mix together and then about 10
01:14
minutes later once your yeast is
01:15
activated add the wet ingredients to the
01:17
dry and mix thoroughly start by tossing
01:21
the mixture with a silicone spatula and
01:23
folding pieces of the dough in on itself
01:25
[Music]
01:28
as it begins to hydrate and a shaggy
01:33
ball appears drop the contents of the
01:35
bowl onto a lightly floured surface lie
01:40
to yourself saying that you enjoy
01:42
kneading dough and really you don't have
01:43
the money for a stand mixer continuously
01:46
fold the dough on to itself for about
01:48
ten minutes until it becomes soft and
01:50
pliable if needed add small amounts of
01:53
water a flower to adjust the consistency
01:55
of the dough roll the hydrated dough
01:57
over the surface to create a smooth ball
02:02
occasionally picking it up and
02:04
stretching it outwards as you push your
02:05
fingers into the center
02:10
[Music]
02:11
so now after breaking a sweat from
02:13
kneading the dough for about ten minutes
02:15
collect it into a ball and place it into
02:17
a lightly oiled bowl for its first
02:19
proofing for this you'll want to get a
02:21
clean rag nice warm and damp and you'll
02:23
drape it over the bowl to make a warm
02:25
environment for the wild and
02:26
domesticated yeast for a simple way to
02:29
enhance the first proof place the bowl
02:31
in the oven and allow the oven light to
02:33
remain on leaving the temperature
02:35
relatively constant and warm throughout
02:37
the proof after roughly one hour has
02:39
passed retrieve your bowl from the oven
02:41
and degassed the dough press crush and
02:43
fold the dough back into it's original
02:45
ball in preparation for the final proof
02:47
this time around you'll want to proof in
02:49
whatever shape you want your final loaf
02:51
to take on I'm going for a rustic half
02:57
dome style loaf which means I'll be
02:59
proofing in my Dutch oven lightly flour
03:01
the bottom of the baking vessel and your
03:03
dough drop the ball in and sprinkle a
03:06
handful of flour on top to help with
03:12
your dough rise use your hand to spritz
03:14
an additional bit of warm water before
03:16
draping your warm damp rag over top back
03:19
in the oven for about an hour or so or
03:20
until doubled in size once removed and
03:25
with your oven now preheated to about
03:27
450 degrees Fahrenheit
03:29
give your dough one last courtesy spritz
03:31
place the lid on and drop her in for
03:33
about 12 to 15 minutes
03:37
[Music]
03:39
fifteen minutes later place your Dutch
03:41
oven on the stove and nearly momentarily
03:43
forget that hot stuff burns remember
03:46
that you're smarter than that and use a
03:47
heating pad to remove the lid back in
03:50
the oven uncovered for an additional ten
03:52
minutes and the efforts of achieving a
03:53
nice golden-brown crust for your loaf
03:56
once you're nearly there switch your
03:58
oven over to a broil setting on high now
04:00
whatever you do do not I repeat do not
04:02
forget that you are broiling or be like
04:05
me and somehow magically remember in the
04:07
nick of time
04:08
place your loaf on a cutting board or a
04:11
wire rack if you have one and allow to
04:13
cool for about ten minutes once fully
04:17
cooled slice and serve my loaf is a
04:20
little under risen which means I
04:21
overestimated the health of my starter
04:23
in the future err on the heavier side in
04:25
terms of the amount of fast rise yeast
04:28
added to the mixture
04:34
