## Ingredients

- 1 package (14 oz; 392g) smoked beef and pork sausage, cut into coins
- 3 cups (435g) thinly sliced Yukon gold potatoes
- 2 cups (3-4 large; 221g) thinly sliced carrots
- 1 large (223g) thinly sliced yellow onion
- 2 tbsps olive oil
- 1 teaspoon EACH: Italian seasoning, dried basil, dried parsley
- &frac12; teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- &frac14; teaspoon dried thyme
- 4 tbsps unsalted butter, separated
- Serve with: ketchup, fresh herbs (optional)



## Instructions

PREP: If you are using the oven, preheat it to 400 degrees F. If grilling, prepare the grill by heating to medium-high heat (425-450 degrees F.) Tear off four sheets of heavy-duty foil and lightly spritz with cooking spray. If you aren't going to be doing this meal in foil packs (See Note 1), line a large sheet pan with parchment paper and set aside.
PREP VEGGIES: Cut the sausage into coins. Thinly slice the potatoes, about &frac18;th inch thick. Thinly slice the carrots and cut large carrot coins in half. Thinly slice the yellow onion. Add the sausage, potatoes, carrots, and onion to a large bowl.
SEASON: Drizzle in 2 tbsps of oil and all of the seasonings (Italian seasoning, dried basil, dried parsley, garlic powder, paprika, dried thyme, and salt and pepper). Add salt and pepper to personal preference( I add &frac12; teaspoon salt and &frac14; teaspoon pepper). Toss everything together until well combined.
DIVIDE: Divide the mixture evenly among the four prepared sheets of foil. Cut the butter into 1 tbsp pieces and cut each tbsp piece into 4 smaller pieces. Add four pieces of butter to the foil packs (1 tbsp per foil pack). Seal the foil packs tightly so no air escapes, but do not double wrap the foil (only one sheet of foil per pack or the cook time will be off). To seal the foil packet, bring the short sides together in the middle and gently fold down to completely seal. Then, roll up the ends.
COOK: Grill for 20-30 minutes or until veggies are fork tender (flip the foil packs at the halfway point). To bake foil packs, place foil packs on a sheet pan and bake for 30-35 minutes or until veggies are fork tender. Campfire: add to hot coals and cook for 20-30 minutes. Be aware they can take up to 40-45 minutes depending on the actual coals temperature, actual thickness of cut veggies, outside temperatures, how many foil packs are on the coals, etcup There is great variance in cooking these over coals.
GARNISH: Carefully open the foil pack, expecting steam to be released. If desired, garnish with fresh herbs (we like fresh thyme) and serve with ketchup drizzled over everything or on the side.


RECIPE NOTES

Note 1: The actual heat on stovetops, ovens, grills, and campfires varies greatly, but I have tested this recipe using all four methods and am sharing the timing I found to be perfect. Time can also vary depending on actual size of veggies, so my best advice would be to check just one packet at a time. Remember, every-time you open a packet to check, it releases all the steam and will take an extra couple of minutes in comparison to the other packets cooking.
- Stovetop (no foil): Place the entire mixture into a large Dutch oven (or half of the mixture into a large skillet) over medium-high heat. Stir occasionally until the veggies are crisp tender (about 12-15 minutes), adding in additional olive oil as needed. Lower the heat if anything is burning or browning too much. 
- Oven (no foil): Line an extra-large sheet pan (15 x 21 inches) with parchment paper. Pour the entire mixture onto it and bake at 425 degrees F for about 30-35 minutes, turning the ingredients at the halfway mark. 
- Oven (foil packs): Divide the mixture evenly onto four sheets of heavy duty foil and wrap them so the foil is completely sealed. Place the foil-wrapped packets on a sheet pan and bake for 30-40 minutes. The time really depends on your preference â€” at 30-35 minutes everything should be crisp tender and cooked through. For very soft veggies, leave them in 38-40 minutes. 
- Grill (foil packs): Divide the mixture evenly onto four sheets of heavy duty foil and wrap them so the foil is completely sealed. Place on a pre-heated grill (medium-high heat; ~450 degrees) and grill for 20-25 minutes. Flip once halfway through the grilling process. 
- Campfire (in foil packs): Divide the mixture evenly onto four sheets of heavy duty foil and wrap them so the foil is completely sealed. Cook foil packs in the hot coals of a campfire until the potatoes are tender, around 20-40 minutes, flipping every 5 minutes, depending on the heat of the coals. We found these cooked in about 20 minutes with hot coals. 

Make ahead: Prepare foil packs according to the directions and seal up the packets. Throw them in the cooler and they'll be ready to go when it's time to throw them on a grill or coals over a campfire. I don't recommend making these more than a day in advance. I also don't recommend freezing pre-assembled foil packs.
