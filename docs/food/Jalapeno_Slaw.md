- 1 small Red Onion – thinly sliced, rinsed in cold water, and drained well
- 2 small Carrots – peeled and shredded
- 2 Jalapenos – seeded and minced
- 2 Green Onions – thinly sliced
- ½ Cup Mayonnaise or more to taste*

- 1/4 tsp Celery salt
- 1/4 tsp Cumin

2. In a separate, small mixing bowl combine remaining (dressing) ingredients. Whisk well to combine.

OPTIONAL, but recommended:  Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour to allow flavors to incorporate.
Notes
While the recipe calls for heads of green and purple cabbage, plus carrots, you can absolutely substitute a (16 ounce) bag of pre-prepared coleslaw mix from the grocery store!  While fresh produce you shred and prepare yourself will always taste the best, using a packaged bag of coleslaw mix is a great way to save time!
If you like your coleslaw on the creamier, less tangy side, increase the mayonnaise to 3/4 of a cup and decrease the mustard to only 1 tablespoon.

When adding the coleslaw dressing to the vegetables, start with 1/4 cup of dressing, toss and then continue to add the dressing a little bit at a time until desired level of creaminess is achieved.  Chances are, you will not need all of the dressing, so it is best to err on the side of caution.
