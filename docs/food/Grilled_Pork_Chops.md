- 3 tbsps lemon pepper seasoning
- 2 teaspoons minced garlic

## Instructions 

1. Mix water, soy sauce, vegetable oil, lemon pepper seasoning, and minced garlic in a deep bowl; add pork chops and marinate in refrigerator at least 2 hours.
2. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
3. Remove pork chops from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade.
