## Ingredients
For the Chicken
- 2 Chicken Breast, halved and pounded thin (So 4 total pieces of meat)
- leftover baked ham or your favorite good quality ham deli meat (Prosciutto is great)
- Swiss Cheese
- 3/4 cup all purpose flour
- 1 tsp Lawry's seasoning salt
- ½ tsp black pepper
- 1 egg
- 2 TBSP milk
- 1 cup Bread Crumbs
- 2 TBSP Vegetable oil
- 2 TBSP butter

For the Parmesan Cream Sauce
- 2 TBSP butter
- 2 TBSP all purpose flour
- 1 cup milk
- 1 tsp Garlic Powder
- 1 chicken flavored Bouillon cube, crushed
- 1 TBSP Dijon mustard
- 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce
- ½ cup grated Parmesan

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. 
2. Slice both chicken breast in half lengthwise, making 4 thinner cutlets. 
3. Put each cutlet inside a freezer bag and flatten with a meat pounder or rolling pin until they are approximately 1/4 thick.
4. Top each cutlet with a slice of ham and cheese – then roll up tightly, tuck in the ends and secure with toothpicks.
5. In a shallow bowl, mix the flour, Lawry’s, and pepper together and set aside.
6. Whisk the egg and milk together in another small bowl and set aside as well.
7. Place the bread crumbs in a third bowl. 
8. Dip the rolled cutlets in the flour first, then the egg wash and then roll in the bread crumbs and set on a plate. 
9. Heat the oil and butter in a small skillet over medium heat and brown the chicken on all sides before transferring to a greased baking dish. 
10. Bake in the oven at 350 degrees for about 20 – 25 minutes, or until no longer pink.

While the chicken is baking, make the cream sauce: 
1. Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. 
2. Whisk in the flour, and continue to whisk constantly for about 1 – 2 minutes. 
3. Slowly pour in the milk, then stir in the garlic powder and chicken boullion, whisking constantly over medium heat until it begins to simmer and thicken – about 5 minutes. 
4. Remove from heat and stir in the mustard, worcestershire sauce, and parmesan until well combined and the cheese has melted. 
6. When the chicken is cooked, remove from oven and serve drizzled with the sauce. Enjoy!!!
