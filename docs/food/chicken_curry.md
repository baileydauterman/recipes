## Ingredients

- 1.5 tbsp oil (vegetable, canola)
- 2 garlic cloves , minced
- 2 tsp ginger , grated
- &frac12; onion , finely chopped
- 500g / 1lb chicken thighs, sliced (Note 1)
- 2.5 tbsp curry powder (Note 2)
- 270 ml / 1.25 cups coconut milk , full fat (9 oz) (Note 3)
- 1.5 cups (375 ml) chicken stock low sodium
- &frac12; tsp salt
- &frac34; cup frozen peas
- &frac14; cup coriander / cilantro leaves , chopped

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a skillet over medium high heat. Cook garlic, ginger and onion for 3 minutes until onion is translucent.
2. Add chicken and cook until it it changes from pink to white.
3. Add curry powder and cook for 2 minutes.
4. Add coconut milk and chicken stock. Stir, lower heat to medium and cook, simmering rapidly, for 10 minutes until sauce reduces and thickens.
5. Add peas and salt. Cook for a further 2 minutes, then taste to see if it needs more salt. Garnish with coriander.
6. Serve over rice, noodles or mashed potato!

## Recipe Notes

1. Chicken -skinless boneless thigh is best because it stays juicy even after the required simmering time.
    - Chicken breast - sprinkle with 2 tsp extra curry powder plus pinch of salt and pepper. Sear first in a bit of oil then remove (no need to cook through). Follow recipe - fry off curry with just the onion. Add breast back in towards end of sauce simmering, just to finish cooking.
    - Shrimp/prawns or fish pieces - as above with breast.
    - Other proteins (beef, turkey, lamb, pork) - use a quick cooking cut that's tender and juicy, slice or dice. Follow chicken breast steps.
    - Vegetables - add into sauce based on cooking time.
2. Curry powder - any brand is fine, I use Clives and Keens. Use Mild for not spicy, Hot for spicy! Note: different brands have different saltiness, so taste sauce at end to see if it needs more salt.
3. Coconut milk - Full fat has better coconut flavour and is creamier. Light is ok but add 2 tsp cornflour mixed with splash of water (to thicken sauce slightly).
4. Nutrition per serving, excluding rice.
