> :bulb: Replace tofu with your favorite protein

## Ingredients
- &frac14; cup soy sauce
- 3 tbsps lime juice
- 1 tbsp brown sugar
- 2 tsps sriracha
- 8 oz rice noodles, I love the brown rice noodles from Lotus Foods
- 3 tsps toasted sesame oil, divided
- 1 package extra firm tofu, drained, pressed and finely diced or crumbled.
- White or yellow onion, sliced
- 2 cups shredded green cabbage
- 1 small jalape√±o, minced
- Red bell pepper, sliced
- Yellow bell pepper, sliced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 4 scallions, sliced into 1-inch pieces
- 1 cup roughly chopped Thai basil leaves, optional
- Lime wedges, for serving

## Instructions

1. Whisk together soy sauce, lime juice, brown sugar and sriracha in a bowl.
2. Prepare the noodles according to package directions (usually soaking in hot water until al dente).
3. Heat 1 tsp sesame oil in a large wok or pan and add the tofu. Lightly fry until just cooked through, stirring often, about 5 minutes.
4. Remove the tofu and add the remaining 2 tsps sesame oil. Add the onion, cabbage, peppers, garlic and scallions to the pan; stir-fry 8-10 minutes, until soft.
5. Stir in the prepared noodles, tofu and soy sauce mixture. Toss well and stir fry for another 2 minutes until the vegetables are tender and the noodles are hot.
6. Stir in the basil leaves. Serve with lime wedges for squeezing.
