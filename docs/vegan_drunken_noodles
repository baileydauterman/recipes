From [Delish Knowledge](https://www.delishknowledge.com/easy-vegan-drunken-noodles/)

## Ingredients
- 1/4 cup soy sauce
- 3 tablespoons lime juice
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons sriracha
- 8 ounces rice noodles, I love the brown rice noodles from Lotus Foods
- 3 teaspoons toasted sesame oil, divided
- 1 package extra firm tofu, drained, pressed and finely diced or crumbled.
- White or yellow onion, sliced
- 2 cups shredded green cabbage
- 1 small jalape√±o, minced
- Red bell pepper, sliced
- Yellow bell pepper, sliced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 4 scallions, sliced into 1-inch pieces
- 1 cup roughly chopped Thai basil leaves, optional
- Lime wedges, for serving

## Instructions

1. Whisk together soy sauce, lime juice, brown sugar and sriracha in a bowl.
2. Prepare the noodles according to package directions (usually soaking in hot water until al dente).
3. Heat 1 teaspoon sesame oil in a large wok or pan and add the tofu. Lightly fry until just cooked through, stirring often, about 5 minutes.
4. Remove the tofu and add the remaining 2 teaspoons sesame oil. Add the onion, cabbage, peppers, garlic and scallions to the pan; stir-fry 8-10 minutes, until soft.
5. Stir in the prepared noodles, tofu and soy sauce mixture. Toss well and stir fry for another 2 minutes until the vegetables are tender and the noodles are hot.
6. Stir in the basil leaves. Serve with lime wedges for squeezing.

## Recipe Notes:
1. Chicken -skinless boneless thigh is best because it stays juicy even after the required simmering time. 
    - Chicken breast - sprinkle with 2 tsp extra curry powder plus pinch of salt and pepper. Sear first in a bit of oil then remove (no need to cook through). Follow recipe - fry off curry with just the onion. Add breast back in towards end of sauce simmering, just to finish cooking.
    - Shrimp/prawns or fish pieces - as above with breast.
    - Other proteins (beef, turkey, lamb, pork) - use a quick cooking cut that's tender and juicy, slice or dice. Follow chicken breast steps.
    - Vegetables - add into sauce based on cooking time.
2. Curry powder - any brand is fine, I use Clives and Keens. Use Mild for not spicy, Hot for spicy! Note: different brands have different saltiness, so taste sauce at end to see if it needs more salt.
3. Coconut milk - Full fat has better coconut flavour and is creamier. Light is ok but add 2 tsp cornflour mixed with splash of water (to thicken sauce slightly).
4. Nutrition per serving, excluding rice.
