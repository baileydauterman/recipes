The first step you need to take for this recipe is to steel your nerves an prepare to lie. You are going to tell people that you made the bacon-fat mayo from scratch. You should probably call it aioli. I've made it from scratch before, emulsifying the melted bacon fat into egg yolks over a double boiler and all that, but I was batting like .350 on not completely fucking it up and soon decided it wasn't worth it. Now I just mix bacon and bacon fat and some other shit into store-bought mayo and then lie to people and tell them I made it. I suggest you do the same.

## Ingredients
- 4 slices bacon 
- 2 tablespoons vinegar-based hot sauce 
- 1 cup mayonnaise 
- 1/2 head white cabbage 
- 1/2 white onion 
- 2 Fresno chilies 
- 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar Salt Black pepper 
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh dill 
- Fuckton of canola, vegetable, or peanut oil, for frying 
- 4 cups flour 
- 2 cups buttermilk 
- 1 cup finely ground cornmeal 
- 1/4 cup Cajun seasoning 
- 4 boneless skinless chicken thighs (about 3 ounces each) 
- 4 circular buns (I still fuck with brioche, honestly) 
- Bunch of pickle slices 

## Instructions
1. Heat a sauté pan on medium heat. Dice up your bacon as finely as possible, then drop it in the pan. Sauté for 10 to 12 minutes, until the bacon is fully rendered and crispy. Strain the fat into a bowl then pop it in the freezer for about 10 minutes. You want it to get to room temp. Run a knife through your bacon bits and turn them into bacon dust. Put the bacon dust in a bowl and whisk in your cooled bacon fat and the hot sauce and mayonnaise, then let it sit in the fridge.
2. Shred the cabbage as thinly as possible. Use a mandoline if you have one. Really, just get a mandoline. Send me an addressed envelope and I'll throw a Bed Bath & Beyond gift card your way or something. Slice your white onion thin. Slice your Fresno chilies thin. All thin everything. It's the Kate Moss of slaws.
3. In a large mixing bowl, combine the apple cider vinegar, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper and whisk together. Throw your slaw ingredients (cabbage, onion, Fresno) in there along with your dill, then toss to combine. Let the slaw hang out in the fridge while you fry chicken.
4. Heat your oil to 350°F in a Dutch oven, preferably cast iron. Set out three large mixing bowls: In the first, dump 2 cups of the flour; in the second, dump the buttermilk along with 1 teaspoon salt; in the third, dump the remaining 2 cups flour, the cornmeal, Cajun seasoning, and an additional 2 teaspoons salt.
5. Take the chicken thighs, wrap them loosely in plastic wrap, then beat them with any blunt object. Maybe work on your jab and punch them to thinness. You want them to be 1/2 inch thick at most.
6. Season up those chicken thighs with salt. Dredge them in the flour, then the buttermilk, then the flour-cornmeal mixture. Make sure to really pack the flour in at the last step.
7. Throw your chicken into the oil and fry for about 6 minutes, flipping halfway through if it looks like they aren't cooking evenly. They're done when the coating is a deep amber bordering on brown. Remove from the fryer and let drain on paper towels. 
8. Toast up your buns. Spoon some bacon-y mayo on both sides of one, place a chicken thigh on the bottom bun, top it with a hefty handful of slaw and a few pickles, and go to work, big homie.
